# deepfakedetection
This experiment proposes a novel deepfake detection model.
The model has been evaluated on three publicly available benchmark datasets - FF++, CelebDF and DFDC.
All facial images have been extracted from the video frames and resized to 128x128.
The proposed model beats existing SOTA deepfake detection models.

The deepfake detection datasets can be accessed from the following links:
