# deepfakedetection
This experiment proposes a novel deepfake detection model.
The model has been evaluated on three publicly available benchmark datasets - FF++, CelebDF and DFDC.
Face images have been extracted from video frame and resized to 128x128.
The proposed model beats existing SOTA deepfake detection models.
